## 🛠️ Required Runtimes

To get the cheat working on your 2nd PC, please install the following:

- 🔹 [.NET Runtime 8.0.15](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.15/dotnet-runtime-8.0.15-win-x64.exe)  
- 🔹 [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.15](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/WindowsDesktop/8.0.15/windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.15-win-x64.exe)

After installing both, run the loader again.

If it **still crashes**, follow these steps:

1. 💻 Open **Command Prompt** inside the cheat folder  
   (Shift + Right-click → “Open PowerShell window here” or “Open in Terminal”).

2. ⌨️ Type the following and press Enter:
   ```bash
   apex-dma-radar.exe


This will show the missing applications or dependencies directly in the console, often with download links.

Install whatever is missing, and you're good to go! 🚀
